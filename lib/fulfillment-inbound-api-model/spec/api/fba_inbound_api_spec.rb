  # unit tests for get_bill_of_lading
  # Returns a bill of lading for a Less Than Truckload/Full Truckload (LTL/FTL) shipment. The getBillOfLading operation returns PDF document data for printing a bill of lading for an Amazon-partnered Less Than Truckload/Full Truckload (LTL/FTL) inbound shipment.  **Usage Plan:**  | Rate (requests per second) | Burst | | ---- | ---- | | 2 | 30 |  The &#x60;x-amzn-RateLimit-Limit&#x60; response header returns the usage plan rate limits that were applied to the requested operation, when available. The table above indicates the default rate and burst values for this operation. Selling partners whose business demands require higher throughput may see higher rate and burst values than those shown here. For more information, see [Usage Plans and Rate Limits in the Selling Partner API](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/usage-plans-and-rate-limits-in-the-sp-api).

  # @param shipment_id A shipment identifier originally returned by the createInboundShipmentPlan operation.
  # @param page_type The page type to use to print the labels. Submitting a PageType value that is not supported in your marketplace returns an error.
  # @param label_type The type of labels requested.

  # @option opts [Integer] :number_of_packages The number of packages in the shipment.
  # @option opts [Array<String>] :package_labels_to_print A list of identifiers that specify packages for which you want package labels printed.  If you provide box content information with the [FBA Inbound Shipment Carton Information Feed](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/fulfillment-by-amazon-feed-type-values#fba-inbound-shipment-carton-information-feed), then &#x60;PackageLabelsToPrint&#x60; must match the &#x60;CartonId&#x60; values you provide through that feed. If you provide box content information with the Fulfillment Inbound API v2024-03-20, then &#x60;PackageLabelsToPrint&#x60; must match the &#x60;boxID&#x60; values from the [&#x60;listShipmentBoxes&#x60;](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/fulfillment-inbound-api-v2024-03-20-reference#listshipmentboxes) response. If these values do not match as required, the operation returns the &#x60;IncorrectPackageIdentifier&#x60; error code.
  # @option opts [Integer] :number_of_pallets The number of pallets in the shipment. This returns four identical labels for each pallet.
  # @option opts [Integer] :page_size The page size for paginating through the total packages&#x27; labels. This is a required parameter for Non-Partnered LTL Shipments. Max value:1000.
