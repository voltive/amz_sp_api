### Example
```ruby
# load the gem
require 'uploads_2020_11_01'

api_instance = AmzSpApi::Uploads20201101::UploadsApi.new
marketplace_ids = ['marketplace_ids_example'] # Array<String> | The marketplace ID is the globally unique identifier of a marketplace. To find the ID for your marketplace, refer to [Marketplace IDs](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/marketplace-ids).
content_md5 = 'content_md5_example' # String | An MD5 hash of the content to be submitted to the upload destination. This value is used to determine if the data has been corrupted or tampered with during transit.
resource = 'resource_example' # String | The upload destination for your resource. For example, if you create an upload destination for the `createLegalDisclosure` operation of the Messaging API, the `{resource}` would be `/messaging/v1/orders/{amazonOrderId}/messages/legalDisclosure`, and the entire path would be `/uploads/2020-11-01/uploadDestinations/messaging/v1/orders/{amazonOrderId}/messages/legalDisclosure`. If you create an upload destination for an Aplus content document, the `{resource}` would be `aplus/2020-11-01/contentDocuments` and the path would be `/uploads/2020-11-01/uploadDestinations/aplus/2020-11-01/contentDocuments`.
opts = { 
  content_type: 'content_type_example' # String | The content type of the file you upload.
}

begin
  result = api_instance.create_upload_destination_for_resource(marketplace_ids, content_md5, resource, opts)
  p result
rescue AmzSpApi::Uploads20201101::ApiError => e
  puts "Exception when calling UploadsApi->create_upload_destination_for_resource: #{e}"
end
```
