  # unit tests for get_catalog_item
  # Effective September 30, 2022, the &#x60;getCatalogItem&#x60; operation will no longer be available in the Selling Partner API for Catalog Items v0. This operation is available in the latest version of the [Selling Partner API for Catalog Items v2022-04-01](doc:catalog-items-api-v2022-04-01-reference). Integrations that rely on this operation should migrate to the latest version to avoid service disruption.  _Note:_ The [&#x60;listCatalogCategories&#x60;](#get-catalogv0categories) operation is not being deprecated and you can continue to make calls to it.

  # unit tests for list_catalog_categories
  # Returns the parent categories to which an item belongs, based on the specified ASIN or SellerSKU.  **Usage Plan:**  | Rate (requests per second) | Burst | | ---- | ---- | | 1 | 2 |  The &#x60;x-amzn-RateLimit-Limit&#x60; response header returns the usage plan rate limits that were applied to the requested operation, when available. The table above indicates the default rate and burst values for this operation. Selling partners whose business demands require higher throughput may see higher rate and burst values than those shown here. For more information, see [Usage Plans and Rate Limits in the Selling Partner API](doc:usage-plans-and-rate-limits-in-the-sp-api).
  # @param marketplace_id A marketplace identifier. Specifies the marketplace for the item.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :asin The Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN) of the item.
  # @option opts [String] :seller_sku Used to identify items in the given marketplace. SellerSKU is qualified by the seller&#x27;s SellerId, which is included with every operation that you submit.

  # unit tests for list_catalog_items
  # Effective September 30, 2022, the &#x60;listCatalogItems&#x60; operation will no longer be available in the Selling Partner API for Catalog Items v0. As an alternative, &#x60;searchCatalogItems&#x60; is available in the latest version of the [Selling Partner API for Catalog Items v2022-04-01](doc:catalog-items-api-v2022-04-01-reference).

  # @param marketplace_id A marketplace identifier. Specifies the marketplace for which items are returned.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :query Keyword(s) to use to search for items in the catalog. Example: &#x27;harry potter books&#x27;.
  # @option opts [String] :query_context_id An identifier for the context within which the given search will be performed. A marketplace might provide mechanisms for constraining a search to a subset of potential items. For example, the retail marketplace allows queries to be constrained to a specific category. The QueryContextId parameter specifies such a subset. If it is omitted, the search will be performed using the default context for the marketplace, which will typically contain the largest set of items.
  # @option opts [String] :seller_sku Used to identify an item in the given marketplace. SellerSKU is qualified by the seller&#x27;s SellerId, which is included with every operation that you submit.
  # @option opts [String] :upc A 12-digit bar code used for retail packaging.
  # @option opts [String] :ean A European article number that uniquely identifies the catalog item, manufacturer, and its attributes.
  # @option opts [String] :isbn The unique commercial book identifier used to identify books internationally.
  # @option opts [String] :jan A Japanese article number that uniquely identifies the product, manufacturer, and its attributes.
