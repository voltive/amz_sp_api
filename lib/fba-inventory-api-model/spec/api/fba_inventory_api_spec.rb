  # unit tests for get_inventory_summaries
  # Returns a list of inventory summaries. The summaries returned depend on the presence or absence of the startDateTime, sellerSkus and sellerSku parameters:  - All inventory summaries with available details are returned when the startDateTime, sellerSkus and sellerSku parameters are omitted. - When startDateTime is provided, the operation returns inventory summaries that have had changes after the date and time specified. The sellerSkus and sellerSku parameters are ignored. Important: To avoid errors, use both startDateTime and nextToken to get the next page of inventory summaries that have changed after the date and time specified. - When the sellerSkus parameter is provided, the operation returns inventory summaries for only the specified sellerSkus. The sellerSku parameter is ignored. - When the sellerSku parameter is provided, the operation returns inventory summaries for only the specified sellerSku.  Note: The parameters associated with this operation may contain special characters that must be encoded to successfully call the API. To avoid errors with SKUs when encoding URLs, refer to [URL Encoding](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/url-encoding).  Usage Plan:  | Rate (requests per second) | Burst | | ---- | ---- | | 2 | 2 |  The x-amzn-RateLimit-Limit response header returns the usage plan rate limits that were applied to the requested operation, when available. The table above indicates the default rate and burst values for this operation. Selling partners whose business demands require higher throughput may see higher rate and burst values than those shown here. For more information, see [Usage Plans and Rate Limits in the Selling Partner API](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/usage-plans-and-rate-limits).
