#Selling Partner API for Orders

#Use the Orders Selling Partner API to programmatically retrieve order information. With this API, you can develop fast, flexible, and custom applications to manage order synchronization, perform order research, and create demand-based decision support tools.   _Note:_ For the JP, AU, and SG marketplaces, the Orders API supports orders from 2016 onward. For all other marketplaces, the Orders API supports orders for the last two years (orders older than this don't show up in the response).

  # unit tests for update_shipment_status
  # Update the shipment status for an order that you specify.  **Usage Plan:**  | Rate (requests per second) | Burst | | ---- | ---- | | 5 | 15 |  The &#x60;x-amzn-RateLimit-Limit&#x60; response header returns the usage plan rate limits that were applied to the requested operation, when available. The preceding table contains the default rate and burst values for this operation. Selling partners whose business demands require higher throughput may receive higher rate and burst values then those shown here. For more information, refer to [Usage Plans and Rate Limits](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/usage-plans-and-rate-limits-in-the-sp-api).
